# Murdery Game

A Next.js Murder-Mystery Party Game

**Live demo**
Directly play the game: murdery.de

**Goal:**

The objective of the game is to discreetly "kill" other players by secretly giving them a designated item. Once a player has been "killed," they click the "I was killed" button, and the killer is assigned a new target.

**Gameplay**

1.  Players are randomly assigned a target player to eliminate.
2.  Players must subtly pass a everyday object to their target without being noticed.
3.  Once a player receives their assigned item, they are considered "killed."
4.  "Killed" players click the "I was killed" button.
5.  The killer is then assigned a new target.
6.  The game continues until only one player remains.
